Priority Queue Dictionary (pqdict)
==================================

A priority queue dictionary maps hashable objects (keys) to priority-determining values. It provides a hybrid dictionary/priority queue API.

The priority queue is implemented as a binary heap of (key, priority value)
pairs, which supports:

- O(1) search for the item with highest priority

- O(log n) removal of the item with highest priority

- O(log n) insertion of a new item

Additionally, an index maps elements to their location in the heap and is kept
up to date as the heap is manipulated. As a result, pqdict also supports:

- O(1) lookup of any item by key

- O(log n) removal of any item

- O(log n) updating of any item's priority level
