Release Notes
=============

1.4.0 (2024-02-14)
++++++++++++++++++

* API changes:
	- The deprecated module-level ``minpq`` and ``maxpq`` have been removed in favor of same-named classmethods introduced in v1.3.0 (#24)
	- Introduce a distinct ``Empty`` exception for operations that attempt to remove items from an empty pqdict, instead of raising a ``KeyError``. (Note that ``Empty`` is derived from ``KeyError`` for subclass compatibility with ``Mapping.popitem`` and ``Mapping.clear``.) (#24)
	- Make internal heap nodes immutable and fast copy as originally proposed by @palkeo in #14

* Maintenance:
	- Factored out indexed heap operations to reduce redundancy
	- Better docstrings and type annotations

1.3.0 (2023-07-01)
++++++++++++++++++

This minor release drops support for Python versions <3.7.
In turn, we now provide full static type annotations and have migrated to modern package build tools.

* API changes:
	- Added ``popvalue`` method to mirror recent ``topvalue`` addition.
	- Added ``default`` argument to ``top`` and support for ``default`` using ``pop`` with PQ semantics. If given, this value is returned when the collection is empty.
	- ``minpq`` and ``maxpq`` module-level functions are deprecated in favor of `pqdict` classmethods and will be removed in v1.4.

* Maintenance:
    - Dropped support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 (#22).
    - Inlined type annotations and removed stub file. Thanks for advice from `@aqeelat <https://github.com/aqeelat>`_.
    - Migrate to pyproject.toml.
    - Linting and static type checking in CI.


1.2.1 (2023-06-26)
++++++++++++++++++

* Typing:
	- Provided typing support (#19) applying stub generated by `@noamraph <https://github.com/noamraph>`_

* Maintenance:
	- Replaced CI badge.
	- Dropped Python 2.7 from CI, no longer supported there. Next minor release of pqdict will no longer support Python 2.


1.2.0 (2022-10-14)
++++++++++++++++++

* API changes:
	- Added ``topvalue`` method (#17). By `@ShivKJ <https://github.com/ShivKJ>`_

* Maintenance:
	- Replaced Travis CI with Github Actions.


1.1.1 (2020-09-21)
++++++++++++++++++

* Maintenance:
	- Performance of ``copy`` improved by avoiding re-heapifying (#12). By `@palkeo <https://github.com/palkeo>`_.
	- Removed redundant heapify call in constructor.
	- Removed unused ``node_factory`` kwargs.
	- Formatting with black.


1.1.0 (2020-08-21)
++++++++++++++++++

* API changes:
	- ``nlargest`` and ``nsmallest`` now support an optional ``key`` parameter (#10). By `Eugene Prilepin <https://github.com/espdev>`_.


1.0.1 (2020-07-12)
++++++++++++++++++

* Maintenance:
	- Dropped 3.3 support.
	- Future-proofed for upcoming collections import breakage (#6). By `R. Bernstein <https://github.com/rocky>`_.
	- Upgraded test suite from nose to pytest (#7). By `R. Bernstein <https://github.com/rocky>`_.


1.0.0 (2015-09-02)
++++++++++++++++++

* Stable release.

* Supporting 2.7+, 3.3+ and pypy. Dropped 3.2 support.


0.6 (2015-08-31)
++++++++++++++++

* Conceptual changes:
	- Clearer terminology in API and documentation (e.g., value vs. priority 
	  key).
	- Functional philosophy: pqdict accepts optional priority key function and 
	  precedence function.
* API changes:
	- PQDict name is deprecated.
	- Several backwards-incompatible changes to fit the new conceptual model.
	- Heapsort iterators (iterkeys, itervalues, iteritems) were renamed 
	  (popkeys, popvalues, popitems). In Python 2, the old names persist as 
	  regular iterators.
	- Dropped module functions except for nlargest and nsmallest.
* Docs:
	- Revised and updated
	- Switch to RTD theme


0.5 (2014-02-09)
++++++++++++++++

* API changes:
	- PQDict.pq_type property: 'min', 'max' or 'custom'
	- fromkeys keyword 'sort_by' is replaced with 'rank_by'
* Bug fixes:
	- turns out PQDict.create and sort_by_value were broken! (oops!)
	- consume: the collector was comparing the wrong pkeys
* Improved test coverage:
	- improved coverage of unit tests
	- using travis-ci


0.4 (2013-12-08)
++++++++++++++++

* API changes:
	- renamed peek() to top()
	- semantics of top, pop, vs. topitem, popitem, *item, now hopefully more 
	  consistent
	- prioritykeys() and iterprioritykeys() are aliases for values() and 
	  itervalues()
	- new methods: pushpopitem, swap_priority, replace_key
* New functions:
	- nsmallest, nlargest
	- consume
* Added Sphinx documentation


0.3 (2013-07-23)
++++++++++++++++

* Bug fixes:
	- off-by one error caused the queue to not reheapify properly in a special 
	  case


0.2 (2013-07-18)
++++++++++++++++

* Bug fixes:
	- Fixed error in __all__ list


0.1 (2013-07-17)
++++++++++++++++

* First release.
